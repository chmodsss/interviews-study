## Requirements

Participants should be software developers with a minimum experience of 2 years.

## Interview scenario

Interviews will be held online via video calls and are recorded for transcription. The participants will be first shown a presentation about a voice-bot used in Software development and asked a series of questions about the thoughts of such bots in multi-tasking. Based upon the exposure to bots, appropriate information will be provided to the participants.

## Research question

1. Does multitasking puts cognitive load on developers, affecting their productivity
2. Do software developers believe voice bots reduce such cognitive load

2. On what type of tasks would you use this bot for?
3. What would you expect from the bot, functional scope and level of autonomy?
4. Would you expect the bot to understand a command entirely in natural language or are you willing to learn keyword targeted commands?
