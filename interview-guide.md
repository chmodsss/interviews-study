# Interview Guide

The following sections contain the basic agenda for our semi-structured interviews. We loosely follow these questions based on the participant's responses.

## Demographic and Professional Background

- Role
- Company
- Years of professional experience
- Programming languages/ Tech stack

## Requirements

Participants should be software developers with a minimum experience of 2 years.

## Interview scenario

Interviews will be held online via video calls and are recorded for transcription. The participants will be first shown a presentation about a voice-bot used in Software development and asked a series of questions about the thoughts of such bots in multi-tasking. Based upon the level of exposure to bots, suitable discussions will be held with the participants.

## Research question

1. Does multitasking puts cognitive load on developers, affecting their productivity
2. Do software developers believe voice bots reduce such cognitive load

## Interview questions

#### Exposure to voice bots
1. Have you ever worked with bots in software engineering?
2. What characteristics did you like/hate about the bots that you so far encountered?
3. You have seen a presentation on use of voice bots. What do you think of such a voice-bot that assists you in workplace?

#### Opinions and expectations
4. Given that the voice-bot will execute actions as per your commands. In what applications, would you like to use such a bot?
5. What are the features that you would expect from such a voice-assistant?
6. Let's take the autonomous nature of the bot. On a scale of 1-5, 5 being fully autonomous and 1 being exactly using the pre-defined keywords that we have hard-coded. What level would you expect the bot to function.? It is crucial to remember that, the more the level of autonomy the decisions made by the bots will become less transparent. The lower the level of autonomy, the decisions are more predictable.
<ul>
<li> 1 - Zero autonomy, Highly transparent;
<li> 3 - Moderate autonomy, moderate transparency
<li> 5 - Fully autonomous, Very low transparency)
</ul>

#### Implementation
7. How should the bot be deployed? IDE plugin, Background process, Standalone application, Webservice
8. Would you rather chat(text) with the assistant to execute your actions or do you like to speak(voice) to this assistant?
9. Why would you prefer the choice? What are the hurdles you might imagine for voice assisted bots?

#### Trustability
10. Would you trust this voice-assistant and why?. What are the measures that needs to be taken to gain the trust in the community?
11. Would you be comfortable to share your data to train the model, given that the data will not be shared with anyone?. This would help the bot to learn from multiple users and provides better performance.
