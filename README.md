# Assuring the Evolvability of Microservices: Insights into Industry Practices and Challenges

This repository contains all publicly available artifacts related to a qualitative interview study about the evolvability assurance of Microservices in the German industry. We conducted 17 individual interviews with software professionals from 10 companies and talked with them about 14 systems with Microservices characteristics. The study took place in October and November, 2018.

## Research Objective

```
    Analyze the applied evolvability assurance
    For the purpose of knowledge generation
    With respect to common practices and challenges
    From the viewpoint of software professionals
    In the context of Microservices in industry
```

## Research Questions

**RQ1:** How do software professionals structure the general evolvability assurance activities for Microservices and for what reasons?

**RQ2:** What tools, metrics, and patterns do software professionals use for assuring the evolvability of Microservices and with what rationales?

**RQ3:** How do software professionals perceive the evolution qualities of Microservices as well as their assurance process and what parts are seen as challenging?
