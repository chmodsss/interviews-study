# Voice Assistants in Software Development: Understanding Practitioner Opinions and Requirements

This repository is created to log all the information related to a qualitative study based on interviews with several software developers to know how a voice-bot assistant serve developers to improve their productivity in Software development environment. The study is planned to be conducted at the start of 2022.

## Research Objective (GQM model) [TBD]

```
	Analyse the: requirements and demands of voice bots
	For the purpose of: quality improvements in software development
	with respect to: cognitive load and productivity
	from the viewpoint of: software developers
```

## Research Questions
