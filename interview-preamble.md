This document describes the general guidelines and ethical considerations of this interview study.

## Purpose of this Study

The purpose of the study is to obtain opinions and requirements about the usage of voice bots in software development. How can they benefit the developers and the prerequisites for trusting such a bot. We want to understand, how the use of voice-bots in software development affects the productivity of developers, if such a correlation exists.

This interview-study is focused on the following points of view
1. To understand the participant's prior knowledge about the voice-bots
2. Opinions on whether such a voice-bot is needed in the development environment
3. What kind of problems would the voice-bot be able to resolve
4. Expectations of the functional features of such a voice-bot
5. How and where should the voice-bot be implemented
6. Trustability of the bots by the community

This study helps to throw lights on
1. the unexplored area of conversational AI in software development
2. how effectively a voice-bot could be designed to suit the developers' need

The study is aimed with the final goal that developers will be assisted by bots, which takes care of small and monotonous tasks.

The goal of this study is _**NOT**_ to push the interviewees towards the use of voice-bots. But to extract honest opinions from the participants about the feasibility and anxiety concerning voice bots. This helps us to develop the bots in a way, which reflects the developers' expectations.

## Interview Process and Analysis
Interviewee has to sign a consent form concerning the data protection regulations. Interviewees will be notified about the general topic of the study so that they are familiar with it and can gather information beforehand should they decide to do so. Interview time is estimated between 45 to 60 minutes. The participant may decline to answer any question or stop participating in the interview at any time, if he/she wishes to do so. We kindly ask the permission of the participant to record the interview for transcription. This helps us not to miss any of the comments. The written transcript will be sent back to the participant for his/her final approval. This is the last chance to remove or redact statements from the interview. After that, the audio will be destroyed and the potentially redacted and approved transcript will be the sole base for our qualitative content analysis.

## Confidentiality and Anonymity

Everything that is said in the interview is treated as strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to anyone outside our research team without the participantâ€™s permission, not even to his/her manager. Results are aggregated and anonymized before publication. In no way can individual statements be traced back to a participant. After the interview, participants also have the possibility to exclude or redact statements before the analysis. The complete interview transcripts will _**NOT**_ be published.
