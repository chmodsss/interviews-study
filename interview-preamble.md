This document describes the general guidelines and ethical considerations of this interview study.

## Purpose of this Study

We want to understand, how the use of voice-bots in software development can help the developers in their day-to-day tasks improve productivity by reducing the cognitive load during context-switching.

This interview-study is focused on the following points of view
1. Opinions on whether such a voice-bot is needed in the development enviroment
2. How and where should the voice-bot be implemented
3. Trustability of the bots by the community

This study helps to throw lights on
1. the unexplored ara of conversational AI in software development
2. how effective can the bots be designed for productive usage from user's perspective

The study is aimed with the final goal that developers will be assisted by bots, which takes care of small and monotonous tasks.

The goal of this study is _**NOT**_ to push the interviewees towards the use of voice-bots. But to extract honest opinions from the participants about the feasability and anxiety concerning such bots.

## Confidentiality and Anonymity

Everything that is said in the interviews is treated as strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to anyone outside our research team without the participantâ€™s permission, not even to his/her manager. Results are aggregated and anonymized before publication. In no way can individual statements be traced back to a company or an employee. After the interview, participants also have the possibility to exclude or redact statements before the analysis. The complete interview transcripts will _**NOT**_ be published.

## Interview Process and Analysis

Interviewees will be notified about the general topic of the study so that they are familiar with it and can gather information beforehand should they decide to do so. Interview time is estimated between 45 to 60 minutes. We kindly ask your permission to record the interview for transcription. The written transcript will be sent back to the participant for his/her final approval. This is the last chance to remove or redact statements from the interview. After that, the audio will be destroyed and the potentially redacted and approved transcript will be the sole base for our qualitative content analysis.
